@page demo Practical demos

For a quick start into libOSCORE,
three demo cases are described in sufficient detail
that only basic UNIX knowledge (installing software, use of the terminal, editing text files) is required.

In increasing order of complexity, they are

* @subpage demo_plugtest_linux
* @subpage demo_peertopeer
* @subpage demo_iotlab

All of them require some @subpage demo_common "common setup".
