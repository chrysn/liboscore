Full integration implementation guide
=====================================

This guide is written for CoAP library authors
who want to make OSCORE available for effortless usage through their library.
It assumes that light integration is already available for the CoAP library.
It is recommended to implement a small application using that light integration manually,
as implementing full integration is largely an automation therof,
and familiarity with the use of light integration is a practical prerequisite.

@FIXME This part of the documentation is not available yet.

    TBD (link into documentation of full-integration libraries,
    and list of interactions still expected there,
    probably only context setup)
