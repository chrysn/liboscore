This is a directory that can be given as an `EXTERNAL_MODULE_DIRS=this` /
`USEMODULE = oscore` line pair to a RIOT Makefile.

It combines a set of backends (nanocoap; pulling in libcose) as well as the
actual sources of the OSCORE module and makes it available in a light
integration style for RIOT.
